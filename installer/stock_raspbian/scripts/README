These scripts are intended to assist with deploying the latest
version of Coder on a clean, stock Raspbian system.

BEFORE PROCEEDING:
You should have a coder user, group, and the coder environment
installed in /home/coder/coder-dist

If you have not done this already, run the following commands
first. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

sudo ./coder_system_setup.sh



INSTALLING CODER:
To update Raspbian with all the necessary changes for Coder
to run, execute the following:

cd /home/coder/coder-dist/installer/stock_raspbian/scripts
sudo ./install_all.sh

This will update to the latest version of Raspbain, install
the necessary dependencies, and make updates to the system
to support headless booting and mDNS discovery.
